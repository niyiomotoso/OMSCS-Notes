## Chapter 1: The Psychopathology Of Everyday Things

> Norman, D. (2013). Chapter 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things. In The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition. (pp. 1-36). Arizona: Basic Books.

Topic: psychopathology of everyday things.

Two of the most important characteristics of good design are _discoverability_ and _understanding_.

- **Industrial design** - the professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer
- **Interaction design** - the focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance people’s understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction design draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience
- **Experience design** - the practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience
- Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology
- **Human-centered design (HCD)** - an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving
- Discoverability results from five fundamental psychological concepts: _affordances_, _signifiers_, _constraints_, _mappings_, and _feedback_; there is also another more important principle called _conceptual model_ of the system
- **Affordances** - are the possible interactions between people and the environment; some affordances are perceivable, others are not
- **Percieved affordances** - often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous
- **Signifiers** - signal things, in particular what actions are possible and how they should be done; signifiers must be perceivable, else they fail to function

## User-Centered System Design: New Perspectives On Human-Computer Interaction

> Norman, D. A. (1986). Cognitive engineering. In D. A. Norman & S. W. Draper (Eds.) User-Centered System Design: New Perspectives on Human-Computer Interaction. (pp. 32-61). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.

Topic:

1. To understand the fundamental principles behind human action and performance that are relevant for the development of engineering principles of design
2. To devise systems that are pleasant to use

Stages of user activities:

1. Establishing the goal
2. Forming the intention
3. Specifying the action sequence
4. Executing the action
5. Perceiving the system state
6. Interpreting the state
7. Evaluating the system state with respect to the goals and intentions

Prescriptions for design:

1. Create a science of user-centered design
2. Take interface design seriously as an independent and important problem
3. Separate the design of the interface from the design of the system
4. Do user-centered system design: Start with the needs of the user

Some terms from this section:

- **Cognitive engineering** - it is a type of applied Cognitive Science, trying to apply what is known from science to the design and construction of machines.
- **Design model** - the conceptual model held by the designer
- **User's model** - the conceptual model formed by the user
- **System image** - the image resulting from the physical structure that has been built

## Chapter 2: The Psychology Of Everyday Actions

> Norman, D. (2013). Chapter 2: The Psychology of Everyday Actions. In The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition. (pp. 37-73). Arizona: Basic Books.

Topic: psychology of everyday actions.

1. How do people select and then evaluate their actions?
2. Role of understanding and emotions: pleasure when things work smoothly and frustration when things do not work
3. How do the lessons in the chapter translate into principles of design?

We bridge the Gulf of Execution through the use of signifiers, constraints, mappings, and a conceptual model. We bridge the Gulf of Evaluation through the use of feedback and a conceptual model.

Seven stages of action:

1. Goal (form the goal) - what do I want to accomplish?
2. Plan (the action) - what are the alternative action sequences?
3. Specify (an action sequence) - what action can I do now?
4. Perform (the action sequence) - how do I do it?
5. Perceive (the state of the world) - what happened?
6. Interpret (the perception) - what does it mean?
7. Compare (the outcome with the goal) - is this okay? Have I accomplished my goal?

Three levels of processing:

1. Reflective - the home of conscious cognition. As a consequence, this is where deep understanding develops, where reasoning and conscious decision-making take place
2. Behavioral - the home of learned skills, triggered by situations that match the appropriate patterns
3. Visceral - the most basic level of processing

Mapping processing with actions:

1. Reflective - planning and comparing
2. Behavioral - specifying and interpreting
3. Visceral - performing and perceiving

Seven fundamental principles of design:

1. Discoverability
2. Feedback
3. Conceptual model
4. Affordances
5. Signifiers
6. Mappings
7. Constraints

## Chapter 4: Scientific Foundations

> MacKenzie, I.S. (2013). Chapter 4: Scientific Foundations. Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective. (pp. 121-152). Waltham, MA: Elsevier.

Topic: what is research?

There are three different definitions:

1. An exercise as simple as careful or diligent search
2. Collecting information about a particular subject
3. Investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts and revision of accepted theories or laws in light of new facts

In HCI research we don’t prove things; we gather facts and formulate and test evidence.

Research, according to the third definition, involves discovery, interpretation, and revision.

Research has a critical purpose: to extend, refine, or revise the existing body of knowledge in the field; this is achieved through publication.

Though citations the body of research takes shape, the insights and lessons from early research inform and guide later research.

Research must be reproducible. The reproducibility standard enforces a process for conducting and writing about the research that ensures sufficient detail is included to allow the results to be replicated.

Engineers and designers create products that strive to bring together the best in form (design emphasis) and function (engineering emphasis). Engineers work in a world where the focus is on designing complete systems or products whereas research tends to be narrowly focused. Research tends to be small in scope where results are incremental not monumental. While a prototype is used to access alternatives in product development, a researcher's prototype is an early mock-up of an idea which is unlikely to directly appear in a product.

Tim Brown CEO of IDEO design firm on prototypes:

> Prototypes should command only as much time, effort, and investment as are needed to generate useful feedback and evolve an idea. The more “finished” a prototype seems, the less likely its creators will be to pay attention to and profit from feedback. The goal of prototyping isn’t to finish. It is to learn about the strengths and weaknesses of the idea and to identify new directions that further prototypes might take

While engineers and designers strive to build better systems or products, in the broadest sense, researchers provide the raw materials and processes engineers and designers work with.

Various definitions of empirical research:

1. Originating in or based on observation or experience
2. Relying on experience or observation alone, often without due regard for system and theory
3. Capable of being verified or disproved by observation or experiment

Three common research methods in HCI which are empirical:

1. Observational method:
    - Encompasses a collection of common techniques used in HCI research; this qualitative approach tends to achieve relevance while sacrificing precision, in HCI, this is the why or how of the interaction, as opposed to the what, where, or when
    - Includes interviews, field investigations, contextual inquiries, case studies, field studies, focus groups, think aloud protocols, storytelling, walkthrough, cultural probes, etc.
2. Experimental method:
    - The scientific method, is where knowledge is acquired through controlled experiments conducted in laboratory settings
    - The relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is one of cause and effect; cause-and-effect conclusions are not possible in research using the observational method or the correlational method
3. Correlational method:
    - Involves looking for relationships between variables, provides a balance between relevance and precision
    - Characterized by quantification since the magnitude of variables must be ascertained
    - Data may be collected through observation, interviews, on-line surveys, questionnaires, or measurement
    - Data obtained using correlational methods are circumstantial, not causal

Tips for finding an interesting research topic:

1. Think small
2. Replicate
3. Know the literature
4. Think inside the box

Some terms from this section:

- **User study** - an experiment in HCI
- **Empirical research** - encompassing both experimental and non-experimental methodologies
- **Facts** - the building blocks of evidence and is what we seek in experimental research
- **Theory** - a hypothesis assumed for the sake of argument or investigation; becomes a scientifically accepted body of principles that explain phenomena once confirmed through research
- **Law** - more specific, constraining, formal, and binding; a relationship or phenomenon that is invariable under given conditions
- **Fitt's law** - body of work originally in human motor behavior that is widely used in HCI; includes equations for predicting the time to do point-select tasks
- **Archived** - research paper is added to the collection of related work accessible to other researchers throughout the world; this is the final step in publication
- **Patent** - is also a publication, describes previous related work (prior art), how the invention addresses a need, and the best mode of implementation
- **H-index** - the most accepted single measure of the impact of a researcher's publication record
- **Controlled experiment** - requires at least two variables: a manipulated variable and a response variable
- **Manipulated variable** - typically a property of an interface or interaction technique that is presented to participants in different configurations (also known as an independent variable)
- **Response variable** - a property of human behavior that is observable, quantifiable, and measurable (also know as the dependent variable)
- **Usability evaluation** - involves accessing a single user interface for strengths and weaknesses (not controlled) whereas a user study is controlled
- **Internal validity** - is the extent to which an effect observed is due to the test conditions
- **External validity** - is the extent to which experimental results are generalizable to other people and other situations
- **Ecological validity** - refers to the methodology (using materials, tasks and situations typical of the real world), whereas external validity refers to the outcome (obtaining results that generalize to a broad range of people and situations)

## Survey Research In HCI

> Müller, H., Sedley, A., & Ferrall-Nunge, E. (2014). Survey research in HCI. In J. Olson & W. Kellogg (Eds.) Ways of Knowing in HCI (pp. 229-266). New York: Springer.

Topic: surveys do not allow for observation of the respondents’ context or follow-up questions. When conducting research into precise behaviors, underlying motivations, and the usability of systems, then other research methods may be more appropriate or needed as a complement.

When used appropriately, surveys can help inform application and user research
strategies and provide insights into users’ attitudes, experiences, intents, demographics, and psychographic characteristics.

Surveys are appropriate for obtaining:

1. Attitudes
2. Intent
3. Task success
4. User experience feedback
5. User characteristics
6. Interactions with technology
7. Awareness
8. Comparisons

Researchers should avoid using surveys when trying to obtain:

1. Precise behaviors
2. Underlying motivations
3. Usability evaluations

Questions to avoid during need-finding:

1. Board questions
2. Leading questions
3. Double-barreled questions
4. Recall questions
5. Prediction questions

Cognitive pretesting is conducted such that the researcher can identify disconnects between their own assumptions and how respondents will read interpret, and answer questions. The pretest could be as follows:

1. “Read the entire question and describe it in your own words.”
2. “Select or write an answer while explaining your thought process.”
3. “Describe any confusing terminology or missing answer choices.”

During the data preparation and cleaning process, research should look out for the following:

1. Duplicate responses
2. Speeders
3. Straight-liners and other questionable patterns
4. Missing data and break-offs
5. Low inter-item reliability
6. Outliers

During analysis of open-ended comments, the researcher may prepare descriptive statistics such as a frequency distribution of codes, conduct inferential statistical tests, summarize key themes, prepare necessary charts,and highlight specifics through the use of representative quotes.

Similar to other empirical research, it is important to:

1. Describe the original research goals and the used survey methodology
2. Include detailed description of the survey methodology (this will explain other variables such as population being studied, etc.)
3. Discuss how the respondents compare to the overall population

Some terms from this section:

- **Survey** - method of gathering information by asking questions to a subset of people, the results of which can be generalized to the wider target population
- **Random sampling** - considered the gold standard because every person in the sampling frame has an equal, nonzero chance of being chosen for the sample
- **Confidence level** - indicates how likely the reported metric falls within the margin of error if the study were repeated
- **Satisficing** - occurs when respondents use a suboptimal amount of cognitive effort to answer questions
- **Acquiescence bias** - When presented with agree/disagree, yes/no, or true false statements, some respondents are more likely to concur with the statement independent of its substance
- **Social desirability** - occurs when respondents answer questions in a manner they feel will be positively perceived by others
- **Confidence interval** - represents the estimated range of a population’s mean at a certain confidence level
- **Linear regression** - indicates the proportion of variance in a continuous dependent variable that is explained by one or more independent variables and the amount of change explained by each unit of an independent variable
- **Coding** - used to organize and transform qualitative data from open-ended questions to enable further quantitative analysis
- **Bottom-up approach** - teh data is coded according ot categories identified by reading and re-reading responses to the open-ended question. has the benefit of capturing categories the researcher may not have thought of before reading the actual comments

## Chapter 2: The Human Factor

> MacKenzie, I.S. (2013). Chapter 2: The Human Factor. Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective. (pp. 27-66). Waltham, MA: Elsevier.

Topic: human factors.

MacKenzie on human factors:

> The deepest challenges in human-computer interaction (HCI) lie in the human factor. Humans are complicated. Computers, by comparison, are simple. Computers are designed and built and they function in rather strict terms according to their programmed capabilities. There is no parallel with humans. Human scientists (including those in HCI) confront something computer scientists rarely think about: variability.

The _why_ question is difficult to answer with empirical observation.

From Newell's _Time Scale of Human Action_, there are four types of human actions in time frames within which the actions occur:

1. Biological - likely experimental and empirical—at the level of neural impulses
2. Cognitive - research on selection techniques, menu design, force or auditory feedback, text entry, gestural input, and so on
3. Rational - users are engaged in tasks that span minutes, tens of minutes, or hours
4. Social - tasks lasting days, weeks, or months

- **Historical band** - operating at the level of years to thousands of years
- **Evolutionary band** - operating at the level of tens of thousands to millions of years

The five classical human senses are vision, hearing, taste, smell, and touch.
Most people obtain about 80 percent of their information though the sense of light (Asakawa and Takagi, 2007).

### Sensors

Terms for vision:

- **Frequency** - is the property of light leading to the perception of color
- **Fixations** - the eyes are stationary, taking in visual detail from the environment; can be long or short, but typically last at least 200 ms
- **Saccades** - a rapid repositioning of the eyes to a new position; inherently quick, taking only 30–120 ms
- **Scanpath** - a sequence of fixations and saccades

Terms for hearing:

- **Loudness** - the subjective analog to the physical property of intensity
- **Pitch** - the subjective analog of frequency, which is the reciprocal of the time between peaks in a sound wave’s pressure pattern
- **Timbre** - results from the harmonic structure of sounds
- **Envelope** - the way a note and its harmonics build up and transition in time—from silent to audible to silent

Tactile feedback, in HCI, refers to information provided through the somatosensory system from a body part, such as a finger, when it is in contact with (touching) a physical object.

Terms for smell and taste:

- **Smell** - is the ability to perceive odors
- **Taste** - a direct chemical reception of sweet, salty, bitter, and sour sensations through taste buds in the tongue and oral cavity

### Responders

Through movement, or motor control, humans are empowered to affect the environment around them. Control occurs through responders.

Handedness is often relevant in situations involving touch- or pressure-sensing displays. If interaction requires a stylus or finger on a display, then the user’s hand may occlude a portion of the display.

However, the eye is also capable of acting as a responder—controlling a computer through fixations and saccades.

### The Brain

While sensors (human inputs) and responders (human outputs) are nicely mirrored, it is the brain that connects them.

- **Perception** - the first stage of processing in the brain, occurs when sensory signals are received as input from the environment. It is at the perceptual stage that associations and meanings take shape

Humans who have lost a limb through amputation often continue to sense that the limb is present and that it moves along with other body parts as it did before amputation (Halligan, Zemen, and Berger, 1999).

- **Cognition** - the human process of conscious intellectual activity, such as thinking, reasoning, and deciding

- **Memory** - the human ability to store, retain, and recall information
    - **Long-term memory** - Experiences, whether from a few days ago or from decades past, are collected together in this vast repository
    - **Short-term memory** - contents of working memory are active and readily available for access. The amount of such memory is small, about seven units, depending on the task and the methodology for measurement

In HCI, our interest in language is primarily in systems of writing and in the technology that enables communication in a written form.

### Language

Language—the mental faculty that allows humans to communicate—is universally available to virtually all humans.

If redundancy in language is what we inherently know, entropy is what we don’t know—the uncertainty about forthcoming letters, words, phrases, ideas, concepts, and so on. Clearly, redundancy and entropy are related: If we remove what we know, what remains is what we don’t know.

## Human Performance

Better performance is typically associated with faster or more accurate behavior, and this leads to a fundamental property of human performance—the speed-accuracy trade-off: go faster and errors increase; slow down and accuracy improves.

- **Simple reaction time** - the delay between the occurrence of a single fixed stimulus and the initiation of a response assigned to it (Fitts and Posner, 1968, p. 95)
- **Visual search** - activity where the user scans a collection of items, searching for a desired item
- **Skilled behavior** - a property of human behavior whereby human performance necessarily improves through practice

Attention is often studied along two themes: divided attention and selected attention (B. H. Kantowitz and Sorkin, 1983, p. 179).

- **Divided attention** - the process of concentrating on and doing more than one task at time
- **Selected attention** - is attending to one task to the exclusion of others

Attention has relevance in HCI in for example, office environments where interruptions that demand task switching affect productivity (Czerwinski, Horvitz, and Wilhite, 2004).

In HCI experiments testing new interfaces or interaction techniques, errors are an important metric for performance. An error is a discrete event in a task, or trial, where the outcome is incorrect, having deviated from the correct and desired outcome.

## Direct Manipulation Interfaces

> Hutchins, E. L., Hollan, J. D., & Norman, D. A. (1985). Direct manipulation interfaces. Human–Computer Interaction, 1(4), 311-338.

Topic: a cognitive account of both the advantages and disadvantages of direct manipulation interfaces.

Two phenomenons that give rise to feeling of directness:

1. Information processing distance between the user’s intentions and the facilities provided by the machine
2. The relation between the input and output vocabularies of the interface language (direct manipulation requires that the system provide representations of objects that behave as if they are the objects themselves)

Direct manipulation as coined by Shneiderman (1974, 1982, 1983):

1. Continuous representation of the object of interest
2. Physical actions or labeled button presses instead of complex syntax
3. Rapid incremental reversible operations whose impact on the object of interest is immediately visible (Shneiderman, 1982, p. 251)

Virtues of direct manipulation systems:

1. Novices can learn basic functionality quickly, usually through a demonstration by a more experienced user
2. Experts can work extremely rapidly to carry out a wide range of tasks, even defining new functions and features
3. Knowledgeable intermittent users can retain operational concepts
4. Error messages are rarely needed
5. Users can see immediately if their actions are furthering their goals, if not, they can simply change the direction of their activity

Two aspects of directness:

1. **Distance** - used to describe factors which underlie the generation of the feeling of directness
2. **Engagement** - the feeling that one is directly manipulating the objects of interest

The goal of gulf of execution and gulf of evaluation is to minimize cognitive effort.

Two aspects of distance:

1. **Semantic distance** - the relation of the meaning of an expression in the interface language to what the user wants to say (e.g., low-code vs. higher-code)
2. **Articulatory distance** - the relationship between the meanings of expressions and their physical form (e.g., a graph in excel vs. an interactive graph which changes based on input in Mathematica)

> A direct manipulation interface amplifies our knowledge of the domain and allows us to think in the familiar terms of the application domain rather than in those of the medium of computation. But if we restrict ourselves to only building an interface that allows us to do things we can already do and to think in ways we already think, we will miss the most exciting potential of new technology: to provide new ways to think of and to interact with a domain.

## Brainstorm, Chainstorm, Cheatstorm, Tweetstorm: New Ideation Strategies For Distributed HCI Design

> Faste, H., Rachmel, N., Essary, R., & Sheehan, E. (2013, April). Brainstorm, Chainstorm, Cheatstorm, Tweetstorm: new ideation strategies for distributed HCI design. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (pp. 1343-1352). ACM.

Topic: brainstorming is more than the pooling of “invented” ideas, it involves the sharing and interpretation of concepts in unintended and (ideally) unanticipated ways. Ideation, in short, is the radical redistribution of ideas to “unconventionalize” a given context.

Effective brainstorming:

1. Criticism is ruled out - adverse judgment of ideas must be withheld until later
2. “Free-wheeling” is welcomed - the wilder the idea the better; it is easier to tame down than to think up
3. Quantity is wanted - the greater the number of ideas, the more the likelihood of useful ideas
4. Combination and improvement are sought - in addition to contributing ideas of their own, participants should suggest how ideas of others can be turned into better ideas; or how two or more ideas can be joined into still another idea

Limitations of brainstorming:

1. Production blocking
2. Evaluation apprehension
3. Free riding

Structuring ideation:

1. Face-to-face brainstorming
2. Nominal idea generation sessions
3. Computer mediated ideation

Model for group ideation:

1. Prompting
2. Sharing
3. Selecting
4. Committing

- **Cheatstorming** - no new ideas are necessary for further ideation to occur

## Chapter 6: The Process Of Interaction Design

> Rogers, Y., Sharp, H., & Preece, J. (2011). Chapter 6: The Process of Interaction Design. In Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction. John Wiley & Sons.

Topic: how to design and build interactive products.

Main points:

1. Consider what _doing_ design involves
2. Ask and provide answers for important questions about the interaction design process
3. Introduce the idea of a life cycle model to represent a set of activities and how they are related
4. Describe some life cycle models from software engineering and HCI and discuss how they relate to the process of interaction design
5. Present a life cycle model of interaction design

### What Is Interaction Design About

Interaction design is about allowing users' concerns to direct the development vs. technical concerns.

### Four Basic Activities Of Interaction Design

Below are four basic activities of interaction design:

1. Identifying needs and establishing requirements
2. Developing alternative designs that meet those requirements
3. Building interactive versions so that they can be communicated and assessed
4. Evaluating them

### Key Characteristics Of The Interaction Design Process

1. Focus on users
2. Specific usability and user experience goals
3. Iteration

### How Do You Generate Alternative Designs

Looking at others' designs provides useful inspiration and encourages designers to consider alternative design solutions, which is key to effective design.

### Life Cycle Models: Showing How The Activities Are Related

The term _life cycle model_ is used to represent a model that captures a set of activities and how they are related.

## Observations On Concept Generation And Sketching In Engineering Design

> Yang, M. C. (2009). Observations on concept generation and sketching in engineering design. Research in Engineering Design, 20(1), 1-11.

Topic: concept generation examined via brainstorming, morphology charts and sketching. Correlations were found between the quantity of morphological alternatives and design outcome. The volume of dimensioned drawings generated during the early-to-middle phases of design were found to correlate with design outcome, suggesting the importance of concrete sketching, timing and milestones in the design process.

Exploring three hypotheses:

1. The quantity of concepts generated at the beginning of a design project correlates with design outcome
2. The quantity of sketches generated during a project correlates with its design outcome
3. Increased sketching at the beginning of the project, rather than at the end, correlates with better design outcome

Method: taking sample data from various courses (three courses with data taken from multiple years as well) and comparing concept generation techniques versus results of the course project for each of the courses. Morphology charts were created in all three courses. Paper-based design logbooks were kept by each student over the life of the project.

Results: A total of 4,008 sketches were counted in the logbooks. 61.4% included dimensions and the remaining 38.6% did not.

1. Results vs. hypothesis 1: hypothesis holds true for shorter duration projects but not for longer duration projects
2. Results vs. hypothesis 2: no statistically significant correlations were found between the total quantity of either dimensioned or total sketches of any type and final grade or contest ranking for the three courses
3. Results vs. hypothesis 3: the proposed hypothesis is shown to be true. In addition, the role of milestones in planning design work may be important, and falling behind in design is linked to poorer outcomes

Conclusion: Concept generation measured in the form of morphology charts showed a statistically significant correlation with both project and final term grade in the introductory course. However, morphology charts in the advanced courses did not show a statistically significant correlation.

## Section 3.4: Mental Models And Metaphor

> MacKenzie, I.S. (2013). Section 3.4: Mental Models & Metaphor. Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective. (pp. 88-92). Waltham, MA: Elsevier.

Topic: mental models and metaphors.

One of the most common ways to learn and adapt is through _physical analogy_ or _metaphor_. Physical analogies and metaphors are examples of the more general concept of _mental models_, also known as _conceptual models_.

- **Implementation models** - are systems that impose on the user a set of interactions that follow the inner workings of an application; they are to be avoided

## Section 3.8: Interaction Errors

> MacKenzie, I.S. (2013). Section 3.8: Interaction errors. Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective. (pp. 111-116). Waltham, MA: Elsevier.

Topic: the big errors are the easy ones—they get fixed. It is the small errors that are interesting.

At the end of the day, however, human performance is what counts. Physical properties, although instructive and essential, are secondary.

Another reason little errors tend to linger is that they are often deemed _user errors_, not design, programming, or system errors. These errors, like most, are more correctly called _design-induced errors_.

## Chapter 5: Human Error? No, Bad Design

> Norman, D. (2013). Chapter 5: Human Error? No, Bad Design. In The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition. (pp. 162-216). Arizona: Basic Books.

Topic: we should treat all failures in the same way: find the fundamental causes and redesign the system so that these can no longer lead to problems.

- **Root cause analysis** - investigate the accident until the single, underlying cause is found

- **Slip** - occurs when a person intends to do one action and ends up doing something else; there are two types: _action-based_ nad _memory-lapse_
- **Mistake** - occurs when the wrong goal is established or the wrong plan is formed; there are three types: _rule-based_, _knowledge-based_, and _memory-lapse_

Key design principles for errors:

- Design for both expert and novice users
- Use the power of constraints, forcing functions, and natural mappings
- Bridge the two gulfs (execution and evaluation) by making options available and status readable and accurate

## A “Pile” Metaphor For Supporting Casual Organization Of Information

Topic: investigation on how people deal with flow of information in their workspaces reveals that users organize their documents in piles thus leading into the desktop interface element - the pile (as seen on a Mac OS).

- **User-created piles** - allow users to create piles of mixed content and multiple data types
- **System-created piles** - system can create piles for a user \
- **Document-centered model** - piles represented as a collection of individual items
- **Pile-centered model** - pile acts more like a folder with a single entity containing a collection of documents
